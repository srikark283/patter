/// The languages Whisper is trained on, as ISO-639-1 codes plus the non-standard

/// for the picker: the codes are what get handed to `params.set_language`.
///
/// 99 for tiny/base/small/medium; large-v3 and its turbo distillation added
/// `yue`, making 100. Selecting Cantonese on a smaller model falls back to
/// Chinese rather than failing.
///
/// English-only (`ggml-*.en.bin`) weights ignore all of this — see
/// `WhisperEngine::english_only`. Parakeet ignores the language argument
/// entirely; v3 auto-detects across its own 25 European languages.
